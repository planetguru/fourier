## Generate a spectral graph from a wav file.
This borrows heavily from the documentation at these links:
-   http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2009_05/column2.pdf
-   http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2009_07/column2.pdf

This also makes use of the WavFile class documented here: http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/audio/javaWavFiles.html, which takes care of all the file IO for reading and writing audio data to and from wave files.
